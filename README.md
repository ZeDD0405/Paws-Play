# 🐾 PawsPlay

PawsPlay is a platform that connects animal lovers with individuals who want to help stray animals but lack the financial resources. Users can request donations for feeding, shelter, medical care, and other necessities for stray animals. Donors can contribute any amount they wish, and the platform ensures transparency by allowing requesters to update donors on how the funds are being used.
