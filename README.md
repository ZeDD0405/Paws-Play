# Pawsplay 🐾

**Pawsplay** is a web platform designed to connect people who want to help stray and poor animals with donors who can contribute financially. The platform ensures **complete transparency** by allowing helpers to update donors on how the collected funds are used, including photos of transactions, bills, and other evidence.
